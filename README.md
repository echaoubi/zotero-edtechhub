# EdTech hub companion plugin for Zotero

This is a plugin for Zotero, developed by [@retorquere](https://github.com/retorquere) and [@bjohas](https://github.com/bjohas) for use in the EdTech Hub. Contributions by @ZainaSaadeddin and @sheraz-ishaq.

To make full use of the KCite function in Google Docs/Slides, also install this Google Docs/Slides add-on: https://opendeved.net/our-tools/bzotero/.

# Features of the plugin

## Right-click menu (on item)
- KCite: (Author, Year). A kind of 'scannable cite' to use with Google Docs, format 1.
- KCite: Author (Year). A kind of 'scannable cite' to use with Google Docs, format 1.
- KCite: Share. Sharing a citation (author, year, title) together with Zotero locations. We use this to share citations with each other e.g. on Slack or via Email.
- KCite Save item ID. Saves the item ID to a field in 'extra'
- KCite Save item details to note. Saves the current items metadata into a note. Helpful if a change in item type might lead to loss of information.

## Right-click menu (on attachment)
- KCite Duplicate attachment. Duplicates an attachment, typically a PDF. This is useful if you'd like to keep a clear copy of the PDF prior to annotation.

## Other features

### Merges
The plugin affects item merges. When items are merged, the fields of each item prior to the merge are added to a note. Helpful if an merge has lead to loss of information.

### Warning if plugins aren't installed
We always use these plugins (for Zotero, at the EdTech Hub). The EdTech Hub plugin therefore warns the user if these are not installed:
- short-dois
- Zutilo
- ZotFile

### Notification while Zotero is getting ready.

There's some function (such as export, or the additional menu options) that don't show while Zotero is completing the startup. The plugin adds a warning that disappears when Zotero is fully loaded.

### Storing items IDs in extras

The reason we care about item IDs (and tracking them through merges, etc) is that that we can embed item ids into google docs. If item ids change, but the 'item id history' is preserved, then they can be updated. Embedded item ids turn into links to our public evidence library, available here https://docs.edtechhub.org (which uses https://github.com/edtechhub/eth-evidence-library-kerko).
